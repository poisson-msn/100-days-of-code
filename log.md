# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 21, 2020
##### a rainy sunday

**Today's Progress**:
1. I have signed in to DataCamp and started "machine learning for everyone" course.
2. I have started to read "Python実践入門", and written some sample code

**Thoughts**:
I'm really not good at English. And that's why I decided to record the progress in English.
No matter how terrible the writing might be, I never give up.
